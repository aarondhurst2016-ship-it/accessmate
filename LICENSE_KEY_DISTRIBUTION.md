The following files are automatically excluded from Git via `.gitignore`:
- `ACCESSMATE_LICENSE_KEYS.md` - Contains the 20 full version keys
- `*LICENSE_KEYS*` - Any file with "LICENSE_KEYS" in the name
- `license_keys.txt` - Alternative key storage file

1. **Never commit keys to version control**
2. **Use HTTPS for all key transmissions**
3. **Log key distribution for support**
4. **Implement key validation in the app**
5. **Have a revocation system for compromised keys**

## üìä Key Management

Track key distribution:
- Which keys have been distributed
- To whom they were given
- Date of distribution
- Support requests per key
- Platform usage statistics

## üö® If Keys Are Compromised

If license keys are accidentally exposed:
1. Immediately revoke the exposed keys in the app
2. Generate new replacement keys
3. Contact affected users with new keys
4. Update your distribution security measures
