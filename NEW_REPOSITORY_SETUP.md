# 🚀 **CREATE NEW GITHUB REPOSITORY FOR ACCESSMATE**

## 📋 **STEP-BY-STEP REPOSITORY SETUP**

### **STEP 1: CREATE REPOSITORY ON GITHUB**

#### **🌐 Go to GitHub and create a new repository:**
1. Open your web browser
2. Go to **https://github.com**
3. Click the **"New"** button (green button) or **"+"** in top right → **"New repository"**

#### **📝 Repository Settings:**
```
Repository name: accessmate
Description: AccessMate - Comprehensive Accessibility Assistant for Desktop and Mobile
```

#### **⚙️ Repository Configuration:**
- ✅ **Public** (recommended for open source)
- ❌ **Do NOT check "Add a README file"** (you already have one)
- ❌ **Do NOT add .gitignore** (you already have project files)
- ❌ **Do NOT choose a license** (you can add later)

#### **🎯 Click "Create repository"**

---

### **STEP 2: CONNECT YOUR LOCAL PROJECT**

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you setup instructions. You'll see something like:

```bash
# Since you have an existing project, use these commands:
git remote add origin https://github.com/[YOUR-USERNAME]/accessmate.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

#### **🖥️ Run these commands in PowerShell:**

**Open PowerShell in your AccessMate folder:**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\aaron\accessmate
```

**Initialize git (if not already done):**
```powershell
git init
```

**Add all your files:**
```powershell
git add .
```

**Make initial commit:**
```powershell
git commit -m "Initial commit - AccessMate Accessibility Assistant"
```

**Connect to your new GitHub repository:**
```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/[YOUR-USERNAME]/accessmate.git
```

**Push to GitHub:**
```powershell
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### **STEP 3: VERIFY UPLOAD SUCCESS**

#### **✅ Check that everything uploaded:**
1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your files:
   - `src/` folder with Python files
   - `.github/workflows/android-build.yml`
   - `buildozer.spec`
   - `requirements.txt`
   - `README.md`
   - And all other project files

#### **🔍 Verify GitHub Actions:**
1. Click the **"Actions"** tab in your repository
2. You should see "Build Android APK" workflow
3. It might automatically trigger a build when you push!

---

### **STEP 4: TRIGGER FIRST BUILD**

#### **🎯 Test your new setup:**
```powershell
# Make a small change to trigger a build
echo "# Updated: $(Get-Date)" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Test commit to trigger GitHub Actions build"
git push
```

#### **📱 Monitor the build:**
1. Go to your repository → **Actions** tab
2. Watch the "Build Android APK" workflow run
3. Download APK when complete!
