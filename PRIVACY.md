No user data is sent to external servers except as required by third-party integrations (e.g., email, cloud backup, translation APIs) that you explicitly enable.

- No analytics or tracking is built into the app.
- Error logs are stored locally and are not uploaded.
- If you use cloud features, refer to the privacy policy of the respective service provider.
- You may delete your data at any time by removing the app and its data files.
