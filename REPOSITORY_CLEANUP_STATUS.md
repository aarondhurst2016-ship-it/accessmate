# 🛠️ **REPOSITORY CLEANUP COMPLETED!**

## ❌ **PROBLEM WE JUST FIXED:**

### **GitHub File Size Limit Issue:**
- **Problem:** Large build files (230MB+) exceeded GitHub's 100MB limit
- **Files:** `AccessMateSetup.exe`, `AccessMate.exe`, build packages
- **Result:** Push was rejected by GitHub

## ✅ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:**

### **1. Removed Large Build Files:**
- ❌ Deleted `Output/AccessMateSetup.exe` (230.62 MB)
- ❌ Deleted `dist/AccessMate.exe` (230.45 MB) 
- ❌ Deleted `dist/AccessMate-Fixed.exe` (230.45 MB)
- ❌ Deleted all large `.pkg` build files
- ❌ Removed `build/` and `dist/` directories

### **2. Added .gitignore File:**
```gitignore
# Build artifacts and large files
build/
dist/
Output/
*.exe
*.pkg
*.app
*.dmg
*.apk
*.aab
*.ipa
```
