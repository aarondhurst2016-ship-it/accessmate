# üö® GitHub Spending Limit Not Showing - Troubleshooting Guide

## üîç **Why Spending Limit Section Might Be Missing**

### **Issue 1: Personal Account vs Organization**
**Check:** Are you on a personal account or organization account?

**Personal Account:** https://github.com/settings/billing
- Should show spending limit section
- Individual user controls

**Organization Account:** https://github.com/organizations/[ORG_NAME]/settings/billing  
- May have different billing structure
- Org owners control spending

### **Issue 2: Account Type Restrictions**
Some account types don't show spending limits:

**Free Personal Account:**
- Should show spending limit option
- Can set limits for Actions/Packages

**GitHub Pro/Team:**
- Different billing interface
- May not show spending limit section

**GitHub Enterprise:**
- Managed billing
- Admin controls spending

### **Issue 3: Browser/Cache Issues**
**Try:**
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+F5
- Clear browser cache
- Try different browser
- Try incognito/private mode

### **Issue 4: Account Verification Required**
**Check if you see:**
- "Verify your account" messages
- Email verification required
- Phone number verification needed

## üß™ **Alternative: Test Without Spending Limit**

**Try running a workflow anyway:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/aarondhurst2016-ship-it/accessmate/actions
2. Try: "üß™ Test Public Repository - Free Actions"
3. **Might work:** Some public repos work without spending limit setup

Please check the billing page and tell me:
1. **What sections do you see?** (Current plan, Payment info, etc.)
2. **Account indicator:** Personal or Organization account?
3. **Payment method:** Do you have one added?
4. **Any error messages:** What exactly appears?
