# üîß GitHub Actions Troubleshooting Checklist

## üéØ **Step-by-Step Diagnosis**

### **Issue 1: Repository Not Actually Public**
**Check:** Go to https://github.com/aarondhurst2016-ship-it/accessmate
**Look for:** 
- ‚úÖ Should show "Public" badge (not "Private")
- ‚úÖ Should be accessible without login
- ‚ùå If still shows "Private", the change didn't take effect

**Fix:** Repeat the public process:
1. Settings ‚Üí Danger Zone ‚Üí Change visibility ‚Üí Make public

### **Issue 2: GitHub Actions Still Disabled**
**Check:** Go to https://github.com/aarondhurst2016-ship-it/accessmate/actions
**Look for:**
- ‚úÖ Should show "Actions" tab
- ‚úÖ Should show list of workflows
- ‚ùå If says "Actions disabled", they need to be enabled for public repos

**Fix:** 
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General
2. Select "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"
3. Click "Save"

### **Issue 3: Workflows Still Manual-Only**
**Check:** In any workflow file, look for:
```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual only
```

**vs**

```yaml
on:
  push:              # Automatic
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch: # Also manual
```

**Fix:** If you want automatic builds on push, we need to add push triggers back.

### **Issue 4: Browser Cache Issues**
**Try:**
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+F5 or Ctrl+Shift+R
- Clear browser cache
- Try incognito/private browsing mode
- Wait 5-10 minutes for GitHub to sync

### **Issue 5: Account Still Has Issues**
Even with public repos, some account issues can persist.

**Check:** https://github.com/settings/billing
**Look for:** Any warnings or restrictions

## üöÄ **Quick Tests**

### **Test 1: Check Repository Visibility**
```bash
# This should work without authentication if public:
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/aarondhurst2016-ship-it/accessmate | grep '"private"'
# Should return: "private": false
```

### **Test 2: Check Actions Status**
Go to: https://github.com/aarondhurst2016-ship-it/accessmate/actions
- Do you see workflows listed?
- Is there a "Run workflow" button?
- Any error messages?

### **Test 3: Try Free Tier Workflow First**
1. Go to Actions
2. Click "üÜì Free Tier Build - Essential Only"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select branch: main
5. Click green "Run workflow" button

## üìû **What to Tell Me**

Please let me know:
1. **Repository status:** Public or Private badge visible?
2. **Actions page:** Can you access it? What do you see?
3. **Run workflow button:** Visible or missing?
4. **Error messages:** Exact text of any errors
5. **Browser:** Which browser and any console errors (F12)

This will help me identify the exact issue!
